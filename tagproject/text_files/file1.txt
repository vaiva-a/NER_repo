On the edge of a small,
misty island stood a little lighthouse named Lumy. 
Unlike the towering lighthouses that stretched into the clouds, 
Lumy was small and a bit crooked, with its paint chipped and its light not as bright as others. 
But Lumy had one thing the others didnâ€™t: an unshakable determination to help sailors find their way.
