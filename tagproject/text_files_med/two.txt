A 32-year-old female visited Fortis Hospital, Delhi, complaining of severe migraines and occasional nausea.
She has been experiencing these symptoms for the past three months and reported a family history of neurological disorders.
The neurologist prescribed Sumatriptan for acute episodes and suggested an MRI scan to rule out underlying conditions.
Blood tests indicated a mild deficiency of Vitamin B12, for which she was advised to take Methylcobalamin supplements.
She was also counseled to reduce caffeine intake and maintain a consistent sleep schedule to manage her symptoms.
